Worth building a way to populate file initially?

If place a team from one quarter as champ, then place another team from same quarter as finalist, champ stays even though that is not possible


remove unnecessary parseInt calls
implement switch statements for 'q' and 'ff' validations

Display some stats
  - % of people picking a given team to a certain round
  - Your picks have the highest scoring potential
  - You've picked an upset in X% of the games. Avg person does y%
What to do about wanting to come back and edit picks?
